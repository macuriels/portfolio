This post is mostly a note-to-self in case I ever need to recreate this effort, but it may also assist you in creating your own website.\nA NOTE OF CAUTION\nIt is worth noting that this post is straightforward and simplistic, therefore it is not comprehensive and does not cover bugs you may encounter along the way. If you do encounter issues, as with most coding issues, I recommend Googling or using generative AI platforms (such as ChatGPT) to search for possible solutions.\nWHAT YOU’LL NEED\nLatest version of R Latest version of RStudio blogdown package in RStudio GitHub account Netlify account Wowchemy website template (recommended: Hugo Academic) Optional: Knowledge of other programming languages (Python, HTML) Optional: Jupyter Notebooks Optional: A web domain STEP BY STEP\nThis breakdown is heavily influenced by Alison Hill’s magnificent tutorial which I highly recommend you read regardless of this walkthrough.\nDownload the latest version of R and RStudio.\nR is a programming language and RStudio is an integrated development environment or user interface to code in R. Both are free and open-source, so you can easily download them on RStudio’s official website (it changes names time from time so I will not add a URL, but as of the time of this post, you can find it on posit.co) This step can be nuanced and complex depending on the operating system you are using or if you are a complete newcomer to these programs - if so, I would recommend searching on Google or YouTube for further tutorials on this step. Go to GitHub and login to your account or create a new one.\nGitHub is an online platform that allows you to save changes online - that way, any changes made to your website using R and RStudio will live not only in your computer (plus we need this platform to download and update the website template). If this is your first time using the software, some common terms you’ll want to become acquainted with are repository, push, pull, fork, commit, and version control. Create new repository in GitHub.\nOnce in GitHub, you will need to create a folder (or repository, often abbreviated as repo). This is where the code underlying your website will live online. Once you have created your repository, go to the main page of this newly created repo, click on the green clone or download button and copy either the SSH or HTTPS. If you are a newbie, choose HTTPS - it is slighltly less secure, whereas SSH allows for enhanced encryption but requires additional steps to set up (if you’re interested, I also recommend Googling or YouTubing this solution) Create new project in RStudio.\nOnce we have the online folder, we will want to create its equivalent on your local computer. To do so, you will open RStudio \u0026gt; click File \u0026gt; New Project \u0026gt; Version Control \u0026gt; Git. Paste the URL you copied from GitHub (SSH or HTTPS), be intentional with the name you want to assign (it can be either the name you have online, or a different name for you to locate the folder easier on your local computer), and click on create project. Use the blogdown package in RStudio to download website template.\nPackages are a compilation of R codes and functions, and can be stored in the form of libraries in RStudio. Developers build these to accomplish specific tasks and, ultimately, save them - and by extension, anyone who downloads them - time. There are a couple of ways you can download and set up blogdown - either by using code or by going directly into RStudio’s Packages tab and searching for it (I personally prefer the latter). Once you have done so, run the lines of code below in your RStudio Console tab. PLEASE READ BEFORE MOVING ON\nIt is important to note that this website is possible thanks to Wowchemy. They are a group of developers who strive to empower creators by offering free, open-source website templates, which are essentially building blocks that you can rearrange and edit at will. This website is built using their Academic template, but you can explore many more on their website.\n## COPY AND PASTE THE TWO LINES BELOW IN YOUR R/RSTUDIO CONSOLE ## CHANGE starter-academic ACCORDINGLY IF YOU WANT TO USE ANOTHER TEMPLATE ## WAIT FOR THEM TO RUN BEFORE MOVING ON library(blogdown) new_site(theme = \u0026#34;wowchemy/starter-academic\u0026#34;) ## ONCE THE LINES ABOVE HAVE RAN, COPY AND PASTE THE CODE BELOW ## THIS WILL RENDER A PREVIEW OF YOUR WEBSITE! blogdown::serve_site() Publish the website using Netlify.\nIf you have done everything so far without issues, you may have seen a preview of your website in RStudio or your predetermined web browser.

To do so, simply go to netlify.com, sign up or log in using your GitHub account, select New Site from Git \u0026gt; Continuous Deployment: Github \u0026gt; pick the repo where you have your website files \u0026gt; click on Deploy Site \u0026gt; Et Voila, you have your …","date":1685750400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685750400,"objectID":"6688b944abe401aed92bf47f35a4ccf4","permalink":"https://macuriels.com/post/website-creation/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/website-creation/","section":"post","summary":"A step-by-step tutorial of how I created this website using R.","tags":null,"title":"How I Created This Website","type":"post"},{"authors":["Miguel Curiel"],"categories":null,"content":"Predicting Depression Based on Musical Taste This is a repurposed analysis of a final project made for graduate-level Data Science class.\nPROJECT SUMMARY\nThis project develops machine learning models to attempt to predict depression based on a free survey dataset with over 700 responses (Music x Mental Health Traits).\nFive classification models are explored: K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Linear Discriminant Analysis.\nAll models achieve a moderate performance, with K-Nearest Neighbors being the best in terms of performance, interpretability, and flexibility.\nEven though all models perform decently, mental health is a complex topic, the assumptions underlying the models are simplistic, and implementing them would require evaluating the ethical implications.\nHaving a background in psychology and having played guitar for over 15 years, music and mental health are two topics near and dear to me. It’s well known that mental disorders affect millions worldwide, and their impact on individuals and society is significant.\nWhile the causes of mental disorders are complex and multifaceted, researchers have long recognized that environmental factors, such as social and cultural influences, can play a role in their development. Therefore, this project aims to explore whether machine learning algorithms can predict depression based on music preferences and streaming behaviors.\nThis post is divided as follows:\nExplore the data Transform the data Build the models Come to conclusions Explore The Data This project relies on the programming language, Python, to explore and transform the MxMT (Music x Mental Health Traits) dataset, which is a survey dataset that contains responses from over 700 individuals about their music preferences and mental health traits.\nThe survey was conducted online from August to November 2022, it was mostly distributed through online channels (such as Reddit), and did not limit participants by age or location.\nBelow is a snippet of the raw dataset as well as some graphics exploring missingness in the data, the distribution of some of the main (numerical) columns, and the correlation among variables.

And even though a single Google search with the key words “social media mental health” leads to the inevitable conclusion that spending more time on social media leads to greater mental health issues - is that really the case?\nThe present project aims to explore this social media-mental health relationship, having as the main question: How does this relationship between social media use and mental health actually look like?\nThis post is divided as follows:\nExplaining the data Cleaning the data Analyzing the data Coming to conclusions Explaining The Data To approach the question in hand, the analysis focuses on a high-level relationship, specifically looking at indicators for both daily social media use and mental disorder prevalence at a country level.\nSocial Media Data Surprisingly or not, data on how people or countries use social media (or the internet for that matter) is scarce.\nGiven this scarcity and the available options, the data used is provided by the Global Web Index (also known as GWI or GlobalWebIndex).\nGWI is a global market research company that annually publishes a flagship report which contains diverse consumer metrics.\nIn particular, GWI’s 2019 flagship report asks 1.7 million internet users aged 16-64 how many hours they spend connected to social network services during a typical day, yielding results for 45 countries.\nAs a plus, this report includes results for previous years, spanning from 2012 through 2019. The data on page 8 of this report is manually transcribed to a CSV file, which will result in one metric that measures how many minutes (on average) a person will spend on social media per day, by country and by year.\nMental Health Data Data on mental health is chosen in function of the data available on social media, especially in terms of selecting age range.\nThis indicator is sourced from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GDB) carried out by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).\nThe IMHE is an international, intergovernmental institute, that has created an interactive database in collaboration with thousands of researchers and policymakers to reflect recent data on over 300 diseases for over 200 countries.\nFor this article, the data is first downloaded “as is” from their online portal, which will result in one metric that indicates the percentage of a country’s population with mental disorders in any given year (i.e., occurrence of mental disorders over its total population in that year). The parameters for downloading the data are as follows:\nGBD Estimate: Cause of death or injury\nMeasure: Prevalence\nMetric: Percent\nCause: Mental Disorders\nLocation: Select all countries and territories\nAge: 10-54 years\nSex: Both\nAnnual rate of change: Deactivated\nYear: 2012 through 2019\nSocioeconomic Data Besides the data on mental health and social media use, we will add socioeconomic indicators into the mix.\nIn particular, we will use World Bank indicators - total population and gross domestic product (GDP) - which are ingested via the wbstats package.\nCleaning The Data There are several data wrangling steps implemented in R once the raw data is downloaded. These include renaming columns, converting units of measurement, and joining all data sources into a single dataframe.\nThe steps followed and code used are denoted below.\nClick to view the R code used for data wrangling # read in raw datasets social_media \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026#34;GWI_socialmedia_2019.csv\u0026#34;) mental_health \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026#34;IMHE_mentaldisorders_2019.csv\u0026#34;) # read and wrangle mental health data mental_health \u0026lt;- mental_health %\u0026gt;% select(location_name, year, val) %\u0026gt;% rename(country_name = location_name, population_with_mental_disorders = val) %\u0026gt;% mutate(country_code = countrycode(sourcevar = country_name, origin = \u0026#34;country.name\u0026#34;, destination = \u0026#34;iso3c\u0026#34;)) # read and wrangle social media data social_media \u0026lt;- social_media %\u0026gt;% mutate(country_code = countrycode(sourcevar = country_name, origin = \u0026#34;country.name\u0026#34;, destination = \u0026#34;iso3c\u0026#34;)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(social_media_use = hms(social_media_use)) %\u0026gt;% # split hours, minutes and seconds mutate(social_media_use = hour(social_media_use)*60 + minute(social_media_use)) %\u0026gt;% #to get total minutes spent on social media rename(minutes_on_social_media = …","date":1665360000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665360000,"objectID":"8b18dcec1b876dfb159264170ff70f17","permalink":"https://macuriels.com/project/social-media-mental-health/","publishdate":"2022-10-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/social-media-mental-health/","section":"project","summary":"A country-level analysis of time spent on social media and mental disorder prevalence using R and Tableau.","tags":["R","Tableau"],"title":"Is Social Media REALLY Bad for Mental Health?","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This is a repurposed analysis of an online course I authored and published on Antropomedia Academy.\nPROJECT SUMMARY\nThis project uses sociograms - networks of social media users and their online interactions - and digital anthropology - the study of human behavior on online channels - to analyze the marketing strategies of successful Latin American healthcare professionals on Instagram. The analysis reveals distinct market segments which healthcare professionals in Latin America can tap into, ranging from people that talk about self-love to users that present themselves as models. From these market segments, there are multiple shared meanings and social representations that healthcare professionals can emulate to reach their target audience, such as posting memes related to healthcare or divulging scientific information. Once we have the data and actionable insights, it is up to each content creator and organization to ponder the feasibility and ethics of the strategy to develop. This project is purposely shallow. If you want to learn more, I invite you to check out the full scoop with Antropomedia! The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the ambivalent nature of social media: It is a powerful tool that can be used to connect with others, but you can also get lost in the noise and can be subject to misinformation.\nI devised this course to study user behavior on Instagram with regards to healthcare so that professionals and organizations can make informed decisions when it comes to crafting their own marketing strategies.\nAdditionally, I go over the concepts and technology used to inform this analysis, covering topics such as network analysis and digital anthropology.\nThis project is divided as follows:\nExplaining the concepts and technology Analyzing user behavior using networks and digital ethnography Crafting your own marketing strategy 1. Explaining The Concepts and Technology Click to view some of the concepts referred to in this project Sociogram: Visualization or graphic that depicts interactions between people through nodes and edges - in this context, the nodes are social media users and the edges are interactions between them (either because they engaged with the same social media posts or because they follow each other). Digital Footprint: The traces of digital data we leave behind anytime we engage, interact, or create something online. Digital Tribe: Concept inspired by the sociologist Michel Maffesoli. It refers to a group of people online with one or multiple shared interests, where these shared interests are an important part of each individual’s online identity. In business terms, these would represent the market segments. Digital Public Space: The point of reunion for multiple users online - in this case, each professional and organization’s account represents a a digital public space. Digital Community: Concept inspired by McMillan and Chavis’ concept of sense of community. It refers to the “map” of the people that congregate based on shared interests within a digital public space. Digital Ethnography: Inspired by the sociologist Christine Hine, it is a wide array of research methods that encompasses other concepts such as netnography (discourse analysis within big data), totems (symbols), and social representations (themes). There are many ways one can approach social media, and there are surely thousands of gurus and researchers that will teach you their own approach.\nIn that regard, this project is heavily influenced by Antropomedia’s unique vision on social media which has helped hundreds of organizations - from small businesses to world-renowned enterprises - increase their reach, value, and profitability.\nThis vision involves integrating proprietary data science methods to download and visualize the data, and social science concepts to make sense of this information.\nDigital Anthropology Most social science concepts used in this project derive from digital anthropology, which is a subfield of anthropology.\nThe core idea of this discipline is that it aims to understand life as understood by people in the light of digital environments.\nIt is also worth noting that it is an interdisciplinary line of study, therefore concepts from other fields - such as sociology and social psychology - are drawn in to fully comprehend online behavior.\nNetwork Analysis This social media vision would not be possible without the premise behind the digital world: Most individuals have a social media profile or account and they leave behind a digital trace (or footprint) of their online behavior.\nFurther, certain bits and pieces of this digital footprint can be publicly viewed and downloaded online without being unethical or infringing privacy policies (to illustrate: think of how you can view who likes or comments a post on Facebook).\nOnce this data is downloaded, network analysis enables a way to view and study this information.
