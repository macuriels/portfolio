Bautista has some of the best lines in the film and he delivers it in a completely deadpan manner. Sure, his acting isn't as fluid as the others but first off its his first main part ever and second the story never really calls on him to deliver a heart-wrenching moment.
The villain, sure he's number 2 but then again wasn't Bane a number 2? Plus was Bane really memorable? Or even Loki if really you knocked the movie for giving us a number 2 villain as Thanos was controlling him too.
It seems like you were nit-picking this film as opposed to enjoying it for no real reason.

It relied too much on cultural references and very specific character traits and was predictable. I expected the humor to be more subtle: hell, even Thor 2 and Iron man 3 had more subtle humor than GotG. The effect was lacking because of the quirky humor abundance.
The main plot was very simple but overwhelmed with subplots. Didn't carry much themes, was centered on the whole infinity gems plot, and instantaneous characters change was really weird.  
The character interactions were sloppy, most of it was exposition, countless of times keeps explaining the plot to raise the tension.

160,UgzRd9aUqy-n8ejwSDh4AaABAg,"I’ve always been impressed by the scene where Peter confessed to Aunt May that he bears some of the responsibility for Uncle Ben’s death. In a lesser movie, or rather, in the hands of a lesser filmmaker, that scene would have ended with May hugging Peter and telling him it was ok and she was so glad he got that off his chest and she loves him so much and tender music swelling.

But she pulls her hand away when he goes to grab it, looks at him like she doesn’t even know who he is anymore, and walks away without a word.

This is brilliant for a couple reasons: One, Peter doesn’t get off easy. This is needed for his arc and for this moment where he tells Aunt May the truth to carry actual weight and have actual consequences for him. Two, that was the love of Aunt May’s life and to learn that Peter was responsible for it would be devastating to her, and she would need the time to process that. Raimi handling this the way he did showed an incredible understanding of BOTH characters.

That’s really what this movie nailed: the characters. It’s a very simple, non-bloated story, and the focus is on the characters and emotional beats like this one, and they hit that much harder for it.

That plus all the scenes of average citizens standing up for Spiderman made us feel like even regular people can be heroes, can be better and make the world less dark. It inspired us to be better people, to push through hardship it never suger coated that life is hard but you have to keep at it and make it a little easier on each other.

When that building's on fire Peter rips his shirt open, omaging the first the film at the festival; almost out of sheer instinct. But then he realizes he doesn't have the suit, nor his powers. Though that doesn't stop him from running in. Obligation or not. But after he saves the little girl, he overhears the fire fighters give devastating news.... several other people died on a previous floor. Were Spider-Man there, they could've been saved. No matter what Peter does he just can't catch a break....

And Aunt May's message about sometimes having to give up what we love most, even our dreams, is very wise as it is hurtful. By the end Peter relays Aunt May to Otto as he himself was never a monster, just a victim of his dreams. By being purely sympathetic he was able to get through to him and stopped the reactor.

For the first time ever with this movie, after years of having watched it as a kid, I actually got choked up a couple times.  Particularly when Peter goes back to help May move out of her house, I was tearing up.  The last time they spoke, Peter admitted that Ben's death was all his fault because he lied about where he'd be and wasn't at the rendezvous on time.  His last moments before Ben's death, he was a jerk, then he holds onto the guilt while letting his Aunt beat herself up for two years thinking she was to blame for allowing Ben to take Peter to the library, only then later for May to completely forgive Peter and congratulate him on his bravery in admitting the truth, gah, it really hit me this time.

Rotten tomatoes it's a joke,  just look and compare the critics from 
SuicideS. (31%) Ghostbusters (73%), Batman V Superman (27%) & Sharknado(82%).... 
While nobody's talking about IMDB! It's very trustworthy, the ratings there are: 
SuicideS. (7.9) Ghostbusters (5.4) Batman v Superman (6.9) & Sharknado (3.3), See? ...
And also the fact that Chris gave it a C to this movie doesn't surprise me because he's very demanding with movies, he's looking carefully the script, transitions,
scenarios and the shots and i totally respect that, that's the value from a movie in the end. But Jeremy, he enjoys watching movies and concentrate in having fun with them! (but of course he cares about the development)...
So, i'm pretty sure this is going to be pretty good!! :D

Can we take a moment to discuss how Leto's Joker was so heavily marketed in the trailers and the actor with an Academy Award gets about 5 minutes on screen? What was the point of all these stories we saw about his method acting for this role & all the magazines that put him on the front cover and asked about how prepared for this role, only to see him for a few moments in the movie?
