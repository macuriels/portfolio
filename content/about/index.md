**THE SHORT-ISH VERSION**

A "too long; didn't read" version of my life story. 

{{% callout note %}}

***WHAT I DO***

I describe what I do as having a "toolbox" of social science concepts, computer tools, and soft skills that I can apply to explain a wide range of phenomena. I communicate these explanations in simple terms to help people and businesses grow.

üß† It all begins with my deep curiosity about understanding behavior (people and institutions).
 
üíª I then discovered cool computer tools (i.e., visualization software and programming languages) that can help understand behavior at a large scale. 

üí° I leverage this toolbox to analyze data and help people and businesses make sense of the world.

> Depending on how technical you want to get, some will call this social data science, others computational social science, and others simply data science or social/behavioral science - I use all interchangeably.

üìàÔ∏è In making sense of the world, I uncover insights and make suggestions to help businesses grow and people perform better in their daily lives.

üó£Ô∏è I will attempt to explain everything in laypeople's terms and be motivated by forming genuine relationships with those around me.

***MY BACKGROUND***

üá≤üáΩ I am originally from Colima, Mexico, but grew up living between Mexico and the US.

üá∫üá∏ I currently live in Washington, DC, with my wife and two cats - Bella and Uva.

üíÜ In my spare time, I like playing guitar and video games, listening to music, watching YouTube videos on diverse topics (psychology, philosophy, entertainment), hanging out with friends and family, traveling, and discovering bars and restaurants.

üì≤ You can find me on most social media platforms as **macuriels**, a wordplay of my full (Mexican) name.

üé• Additional fun fact: I love audiovisual arts and have dabbled with being a YouTuber multiple times in my life - from comedy sketches and guitar covers to educational videos.

**THE LONGER VERSION**

Ever since I was a kid, I've liked making friends and solving problems, which undoubtedly correlates to the fact that I have pursued a career in behavioral science and data science. So where did all of this begin?

{{< spoiler text="*Click to read a longer version of my life story*" >}}

I partially blame growing up in two cultures for my interest in behavior. I spent most of my childhood living between the US and Mexico, and even though they are neighboring countries, personalities and lifestyles can be radically different. Ultimately, this exposure to dual ways of life instilled in me a deep appreciation for diversity and human connections.

I am not sure whom to blame for my interest in science - but if I had to point fingers, I'd say my parents (and I mean it in a good way!). For one, they were top performers at school, which certainly raised the bar for my performance. But more than that, I would say that, by trying hard at school, I grew to love solving problems - which is something I most prominently encountered in my science classes and was further entrenched through games, most prominently video games (my initial exposure was to Pokemon's Silver Version for the GameBoy Color - also courtesy of my parents!).

*From Problem-solving to Engineering*

My passion for science and problem-solving led me to start my education as an engineer. Even though I made some of my best friends in engineering and highly enjoyed my science classes, after two years and an internship with the government, I realized my calling lay in helping and understanding behavior (people and organizations). It was then that I decided to switch gears and pursue a degree in psychology.

*From Engineering to Social Science*

Coming from two years of engineering and having a liking for problem-solving, I naturally gravitated toward research-focused classes. Courses such as Neuropsychology or Quantitative/Qualitative Methods would be the foundations of my future work pursuits.

*From Social Science to Neuroscience*

While still in college, I sought professional opportunities and landed a job as a Neuroscience Practitioner at a neuropsychology and applied neuroscience institute. I would end up spending four years at this job, where I learned about neuroscience while helping people - mostly kids and teenagers diagnosed with ADHD. One of the main takeaways from this experience was making science accessible - imagine trying to convince a five-year-old kid that staying put for an electroencephalogram is fun!

*From Neuroscience to Research*

But the most important takeaway was that I was further compelled to follow an analytical path. After a couple of years as a Neuroscience Practitioner, I was invited to develop a research paper with other institute members. As of the time of this writing, the article is still a work in progress, but I was able to write our first draft, manage our database, and have my first approach to machine learning and programming.

*From One Research Project to Three*

It is worth noting that while I worked at the neuroscience institute and was pursuing my undergraduate degree, I worked with two other organizations (burnout much? A little bit, yes! But I also learned a lot about time management). I landed a part-time internship with MIT's Enterprise Forum (MITEF) chapter in Guadalajara, Mexico, and almost simultaneously, I started working as an analyst at a market research agency.

*Adding Computers to Social Science*

These experiences would be foundational in using social science and computer tools to analyze and model data (this branch of knowledge is usually called computational social science or social data science, depending on who you ask and how technical you want to get). It all began at the market research agency, where I was introduced to the notion of using big data and modern analytical techniques such as network analysis - interpreted from the eyes of the social sciences - to understand behavior.

This core idea has stuck with me ever since and was further reinforced through my time at MITEF. I mainly worked as a data analyst on a project studying economic ecosystems in Mexico, and even though it was a different use case than market research, I was able to apply the same logic: Use computer tools to visualize data and analyze it from a social science perspective.

*From Understanding Data to Understanding Customers*

After graduating from psychology and finishing my internship, I continued working for a few years at the neuroscience institute and the market research agency. I saw the institute grow and went through promotions at the market research agency until I became a Tribe (research) Manager. Being a research manager entailed being in direct contact with customers, which opened a whole new world for me. The core question I would frequently ask myself was: How will I explain highly technical market research concepts to executives at large enterprises so that they see the value, so much so that they are willing to invest in our services and apply our suggestions? This would also entail working with customers on the logistics of projects, which encompassed questions such as: What are our research questions? What's our timeline? What key performance indicators should we establish?

*From Managing Research to Managing Education*

The pandemic hit while I worked at the neuroscience institute and the market research agency. This freed up some of my time, and seeing as I liked being involved in multiple projects, I decided to take this era to study and, eventually, even authored my own study programs and led a startup. At this time, I discovered online learning platforms and enrolled in two specializations - one in statistics for social sciences and the other in computational social science.

Inspired by my experience at these learning platforms, I created my first online course on digital research methods for healthcare professionals. I mentioned this to a colleague who already had his successful online learning platform for lawyers, which sparked the idea: What if we do something similar, but for psychologists? He saw potential in teaching psychology to entrepreneurs, and I saw potential in bridging the gap between what universities were teaching and the developments in modern psychology.

Now, I would love to say how this startup is valued at millions - unfortunately, that is not the case. Even though I met great people from all over the world, created two online courses, and had a taste of what it's like to lead a fully remote company, I ultimately failed to generate sufficient interest for the initiative to be profitable. Because of that - and because my life situation was about to change - we put this project on hold indefinitely.

Around this time, my family and I decided to settle in the United States. From this time onward, I would continue to follow a career in computational social science by working at a tech company and pursuing a master's degree. 

*The Road Ahead*

What's to come is still a mystery, but if there's anything I can take away from the journey thus far is the great people - customers, colleagues, friends, and mentors - I have met along the way. I can talk all day about cool analytical techniques, the latest behavioral science theory, or problems facing our society, but without having people to share with and learn from, not only would this be impossible, but it would also be near-worthless.

On that note, if you've made it this far: Thank you, dear reader! We are on this journey together, I wish you the best on your road ahead, and if we haven't done so, I hope we can connect soon.
